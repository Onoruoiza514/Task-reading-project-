# Task Reading Project

## Overview
The **Task Reading Project** is a class project aimed at developing a tool to automate the reading, organization, and analysis of task-related data. This project showcases practical applications of automation and scripting, integrating skills in data handling,and task management.

## Features
- **Task Importing:** Reads task data from structured files (e.g., CSV, JSON) or APIs.
- **Data Organization:** Organizes tasks by priority, category, or due date.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Summarizes key metrics such as completed tasks,over due tasks and the rest
- **Export Options:** Allows exporting organized task data into various formats (CSV, Excel, etc.).

## How It Works
1. **Input Task Data:** Users provide a task file or API endpoint for the system to read.
2. **Process and Analyze:** The tool parses the data, organizes it, and provides insightful summaries.
3. **Output Results:** Users can view the organized tasks and export the results for further use.

## Usage
This project can be used by:
- **Students:** To learn and practice automation and scripting concepts.
- **Project Managers:** For organizing and visualizing team tasks.
- **Developers:** As a foundation to build more advanced task management tools.

   ```
3. Run the script:
